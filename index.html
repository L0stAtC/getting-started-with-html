<h1>Important Concepts</h1>

<b>The Basics of the Web</b>

<p> There are five (5) main elements of the web:
<br> ~ the web
<br> ~ HTML (The main document type of the web)
<br> ~ URLs (How you refer to documents on the web)
<br> ~ HTTP (The protocol that unites the web; that the web runs on; that computers use to 
communicate with servers)
<br> ~ web applications</p>

<p>The <b><u> World Wide Web</u></b> is a collection of HTML documents that was invented in 
the early 1990's, and contains roughly 30 billion pages. </p>
<p><b><u> HTML </u> : </b>  Hyper Text Mark-up Language 
<br> ~ The basis for almost every web page.
<br> ~ What glues everything together.
<br> ~ The main kind of content on the web.</p>  

<p><b><u> Hyper Links </u> : </b> are the <em> links </em> that make the web web-like.</p>

<p><b><u>Browser</u> : </b>A program that runs on your computer to display files found on the 
web.</p>

<p><b><u>Internet</u> : </b>The world's largest computer network.</p>

<p><b><u>HTTP</u> : </b>The main protocol of the web.</p>

<p><b><u>Servers</u> : </b>Computers that host the files that make up the web.</p>

<p>The internet uses <em>HTTP</em> to communicate with you, your browser, and servers.</p>

<p>HTTP Request</em> to a <em>server</em>. The server finds the appropriate HTML document and
sends it back to the user's computer where a <em>web browser</em> interprets the page and 
displays it on the user's screen.

 This video</a> does a good job of explaining. </p>

<p><b><u>HTML</u> : </b>stands for Hyper Text Mark-up Language.  <em> HTML </em>is made up of: 
<br> ~ text content (what you see)
<br> ~ markup (what the content looks like or how it's arranged)
<br> ~ references to other documents (e.g. images and videos)
<br> ~ links to other pages

<br><br>  <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48724340"> This
  video</a> gives a good overview.</p>

<br>

<b>Tags and Elements</b>
<p>HTML documents are made of HTML <b>elements</b>. When
  writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML <b>tags</b>. A 
  <em>void tag</em> has no content, and therefore needs no closing tag. It is often a good idea
  to make a closing tag as soon as you make an opening tag.  
  <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48723444">This video</a>
  explains the distinction between elements and tags well.</p>

<p> <b><u>Tag Examples</u> : </b>
<br> ~ <b>b:</b> Bold
<br> ~ <b>em:</b> Emphasis (italics)
<br> ~ <b>a:</b> Anchor (for  making links)
<br> ~ <b>img:</b> Images (a void tag)
<br> ~ <b>br:</b> Break (a void tag)
<br> ~ <b>p:</b> Paragraph
<br> ~ <b>u:</b> Underline</p>

<br><br>

<b>Why Computers are Stupid</b>
<p>Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions
  literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a
  small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems
  in a program.</p>

<br><br>

<b>HTML Attributes</b>
<!-- <TAG ATTR = "VALUE"> Contents </TAG> -->

<p>Attributes (these days) <em>always</em> equals a value.  Tags can have multiple 
  attributes.  </p>

<!-- Anchor Tag ~ <a href = "www.reddit.com"> derp </a> -->

<p>In an anchor tag, href is the attribute name, the URL is the value, and within
the contents is the link to the URL.</p>

<!-- Image Tag ~ <img src = "URL"> alt = "text" -->

<p>In an image tag, src stands for the source; the URL is where the image can be 
found to download; alt stands for alternate; the alternate text is the text that gets 
displayed should the image not load.  The alternate text is required for broken requests
  and blind people.  Because there is <u>no</u> contents to an image, there is <u>no</u>
  closing tag.  </p>

<b>Inline vs Block Elements</b>
<p>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block
  elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of
  them.</p>

<p><b><u>Container Elements</u> : </b> Elements that do nothing but contain stuff inside them.
  These elements can be used to create web pages with complex structures.  </p> 

<br> ~ <b>Break (b):</b> Inline
<br> ~ <b>Paragraph (p):</b> Block
<br> ~ <b>Span:</b> Inline (and a container element)
<br> ~ <b>Div:</b> Block (and a container element)

<br><br>

<h2>SUMMARY</h2>

<p> <br> ~ A <b><u>web page</u></b> is a text document written in a language called 
<b><u>HTML</u></b>.  <b><u>Web browsers</u></b> read these documents, and then interpret, and
display them.  <br>
<br> ~ <b><u>Coding</u></b> happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer 
can understand.  The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote.  <br>
<br> ~ Computers are stupid.  Programmers need to write <em><u>exactly</u></em> the way a 
computer understands. This is also known as writing with correct "syntax". <br>
<br> ~ Programmers can't remember everything.  There are too many details to keep everything
in your head.  You can always look it up.  <br>
<br> ~ Basic HTML Vocabulary:
  <br> ~ <b>Tag:</b> An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets.  Most tags have
  an opening tag and a closing tag. <b><u>Void</u></b> tags do <em><u>not</u></em> require
  a closing tag.  
<br> ~ <b>Element:</b> An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and
closing tags.
<br> ~ <b>Attribute:</b> This is a property of an HTML element.
